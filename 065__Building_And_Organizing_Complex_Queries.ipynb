Name aliases should be clear– a common convention is using the first letter of the table name, however if you feel that a query is complex you should consider using more explicit aliases. Similarly, at times lines like `GROUP BY 1` can be confusing, and explicitly naming the column will make your query more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you work in a team, you might consider a SQL style guide— a great guide is available at [SQL style guide](http://www.sqlstyle.guide/), but remember that readability is more important than consistency. If you have a complex query and you think breaking the style guide will make it more readable, you should do it.\n",
