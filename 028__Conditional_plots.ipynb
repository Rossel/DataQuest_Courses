We've also explored how we can combine those plots in interesting ways to convey deeper insights and continue to extend the storytelling power of data visualization. In this mission, we'll explore how to quickly create multiple plots that are subsetted using one or more conditions.\n",

Here are some examples of some complex plots that can be created using seaborn:\n",

The [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic) is the most famous shipwreck in history and led to the creation of better safety regulations for ships.
