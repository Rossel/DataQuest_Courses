# DataQuest_Courses

This is a collection of notes I am taking for the course [Data Analytics with Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/) on DataQuest. 

The notes were written in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), which can be likened to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) within the Google Suite. It allows users to write notes, run code and visualise data within the same document. It also provides the option to save notebooks on GitHub, which for me is an excellent place to store them for future reference.

Please keep in mind that these notes are not intended to be shared with others or to teach others. They are created for my own personal reference, which explains why certain concepts may not be properly introduced, why Dutch language is sometimes mixed with English, and why there might be many more such trivialities... =)
