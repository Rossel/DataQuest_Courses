# DataQuest_Courses

This is a collection of notes I am taking for the course [Data Analytics with Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/) on DataQuest. 

The notes were written in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), which can be likened to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) within the Google Suite. It allows users to write notes, run code and visualise data within the same document. It also provides the option to save notebooks on GitHub, which for me is an excellent place to store them for future reference.

Please keep in mind that these notes are not intended to share with others or teach others. They are created for my personal reference, which is also why certain concepts may not be properly introduced, Dutch language is mixed with English, and other trivialities. :)
