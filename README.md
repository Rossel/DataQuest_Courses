# DataQuest_Courses

This is a collection of notes I am taking for the course [Data Analytics with Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/) on DataQuest. 

The notes were written in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), which can be likened to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) within the Google Suite. It allows users to write notes, run code and visualise data within the same document. It also provides provides the option to save notebooks on GitHub, which makes it an excellent place to store them for future reference.
