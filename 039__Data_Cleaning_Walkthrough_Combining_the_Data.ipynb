        "In the last mission, we began investigating possible relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about [New York City public schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data?cat=education). We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the `DBN` column. All of the data sets are currently stored as keys in the `data` dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n",
